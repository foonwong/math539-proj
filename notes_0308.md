### Paper details
- 2 pages

    * Clustering methods
    * model to generate pricing
    * Framework on experiment, data collection and modeling process.


### Purpose of paper
* Used by Panasonic at AIX - industry show to showcase machine learning efforts
to industry peers.
       

### TODOs 
- This weekend: In-depth reading of one paper. Check in with Foon to go over
the things that we can apply

- Monday: Team meeting. Select ideas as a team. Not all of us need to write the
paper, but we should all be ready to turn our findings into paper at this
point because paper is due Thursday.

- Tuesday: Check in with Sam to finalize what goes in the paper. Write paper.


### Waiting from Sam:
- Random forest model notebook for take rate (by product) prediction
- Confluence notes explaining the take rate model 


### Suggestions from Sam:
- Look into seasonal effects such as holiday or major sporting event - does
that change things?


### Current ideas: 
- 1 (Romain). Qiang paper - Demand regression model to generate optimal pricing.
This should be highly applicable.
